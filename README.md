# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to ChatMap

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app  
  
  Do not run the app with expo go. It will not work. It is not yet designed to work in web. It only works in android and iphone. Also do not run in a simulator. Use a real device. Either

   ```bash
    npx expo run:android
   ```
   or
      ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
   ```

Fix any errors you get. There is plenty of documentation online.
